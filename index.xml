In 2007, together with Alex Hertel and Philipp Hertel, I co-founded Zetawire. It was acquired by Google from stealth mode in 2010, and formed the base for the Google Wallet product.
Between 2008 and 2010 I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Microsoft Research New England lab.</description></item><item><title>Members</title><link>https://mbraverm.github.io/team/members/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mbraverm.github.io/team/members/</guid><description>Current Group Members Graduate students: Antonio Molina Lovett Postdocs: Vijay Bhattiprolu John Peebles Sahil Singla Alumni: With first place of employment/study:

New bounds on the Grothendieck constant Let be an matrix. It gives rise to the quadratic form . The Grothendieck constant bounds the ratio between the maximum of this form when are unit vectors in a Hilbert space and the maximum of this form when are just real numbers.</description></item><item><title>Funding</title><link>https://mbraverm.github.io/about/funding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mbraverm.github.io/about/funding/</guid><description>I gratefully acknowledge the following funding sources: Present: NSF, through the Alan T.

Princeton CS Theory group: Please see Princeton academic jobs portal here, and navigate to opportunities in Computer Science. The Theory Group typically advertises a postdoctoral research associate position and an associate research scholar position, which is slightly more senior. Both positions are reviewed in the late Fall, with the goal of making decisions by January/February.

Abstract: There is a growing power imbalance between companies who have access to powerful algorithms and processing capacity and users who donâ€™t. To restore the balance, we need to put equally powerful algorithms in the hands of individuals. There are two concrete steps we recommend:
(1) there should be a new regulatory framework which creates an unbreakable commitment for an advocate (a digital service) to work exclusively in the interest of its client;</description></item><item><title>All Papers</title><link>https://mbraverm.github.io/research/all-papers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mbraverm.github.io/research/all-papers/</guid><description>Selected recent publications Network coding in undirected graphs is either very helpful or not helpful at all
