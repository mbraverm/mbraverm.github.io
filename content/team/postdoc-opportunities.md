**We have several exciting postdoctoral opportunities in Princeton and the area.**

### Princeton CS Theory group:

Please see Princeton academic jobs portal [here](https://dof.princeton.edu/academicjobs), and navigate to opportunities in Computer Science. 
The Theory Group typically advertises a postdoctoral research associate position and an associate research scholar position, which is slightly more senior. Both positions 
are reviewed in the late Fall, with the goal of making decisions by January/February.
