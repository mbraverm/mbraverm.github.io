I received my PhD in 2008 from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) under the supervision of [Stephen Cook](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/%7Esacook).

In 2007, together with [Alex Hertel](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~ahertel/) and [Philipp Hertel](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~philipp/), I co-founded Zetawire. It was acquired by Google from stealth mode in 2010, and formed the base for the [Google Wallet](https://www.google.com/wallet/) product.

Between 2008 and 2010 I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Microsoft Research New England](https://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/labs/newengland/default.aspx) lab.

In 2010-11 I was an assistant professor jointly appointed at the Departments of [Mathematics](https://www.math.utoronto.ca/) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

I have been a professor of computer science at Princeton since 2015. I joined Princeton in 2011 as an assistant professor.

With my [students and postdocs](/team/current-members/) I work in complexity theory, the theory of real computation, machine learning, algorithms, game theory, and applications of computer science in healthcare and medicine. You can find my publications
[here](/research/all-papers/). My research is supported by a number of [awards](/about/funding/), including a 2011 Sloan Fellowship and a 2013 Packard Fellowship.
