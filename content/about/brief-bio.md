I received my BA in mathematics and computer science in 2001 from the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/).  

I received my PhD in 2008 from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) under the supervision of [Stephen Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cook). My thesis was on the [computability and complexity of Julia sets](/research/dynamics-and-computation/), a topic on which I worked with [Michael Yampolsky](https://www.math.toronto.edu/yampol/).

Between 2008 and 2010 I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Microsoft Research New England](https://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/labs/newengland/default.aspx) lab, then run by [Jennifer Chayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Tour_Chayes).

In 2010-11 I was an assistant professor jointly appointed at the Departments of [Mathematics](https://www.math.utoronto.ca/) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

I have been a professor of computer science at Princeton University since 2015. I joined Princeton in 2011 as an assistant professor.

With my [students and postdocs](/team/members/) I work on theoretical computer science, and its connections to other disciplines, especially in information theory, mathematical analysis, and economics. You can find my publications
[here](/research/all-papers/). My research is supported by a number of [awards](/about/funding/), including a 2013 Packard Fellowship and a 2019 NSF Waterman award.  

I've been married to Anna since 2007. You can find her website [\[here\]](https://soilforroots.com/).
