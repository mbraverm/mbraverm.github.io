This page is under construction. It will cover current/near-future research direction (mainly for prospective students). 

### Current and near-future research directions

##### Mechanism design, algorithms, and learning

##### Computational complexity theory

##### Algorithms and lower bounds for new models of computation 

Later I will add distant-future research directions.
