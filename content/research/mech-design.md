**Algorithm design vs. mechanism design.** The starting point of *Algorithm design* is a specified input-output behavior: $X$ is a list of numbers, and $A(X)$ is the same list sorted in ascending order; $x$ is boolean formula, and $A(x)$ is a satisfying assignment -- if one exists; $x$ is a list of labeled examples, and $A(x)$ is a trained model for labeling previously unseed examples. Some of these tasks are incredibly complex. Much of computer science is about finding new ways of performing these tasks. No matter how complex the algorithmic task at hand, it is usually assumed that the input $x$ does not depend on algorithm $A$.
