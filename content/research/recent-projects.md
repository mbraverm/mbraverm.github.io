#### Information complexity

Information theory is a vastly successful theory underpinning much of our communication technology. In many important communication scenarios it allows one to calculate the precise amount of resources needed to perform a cetrain task. For example, the number of bits Alice needs to communicate to send a string $x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n$ of $n$ random trits (elements from $\{1,2,3\}$) to Bob is given by $(\log_2 3) \cdot n \pm o(n)$. The number of bits Alice needs to communicate to send $n$ random trits to Bob if Bob already knows half of the $x$'s (regarless of whether Alice knows which locations are known to Bob) is  $\frac{\log_2 3}{2}\cdot n \pm o(n)$ etc.
