A *[dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system)* is a stateful system (often with a continuous state space) evolving over time. Thus, dynamical systems can be (and are being) used to capture the behavior of both natural and articifical systems over time. 
The state space of dynamical systems is typically continuous, which means that one has to look at continuous models of computation. [Here](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/9/167157-computing-with-real-numbers-from-archimedes-to-turing-and-beyond/fulltext) is a Communications of the ACM article I wrote on computation over the reals in 2013. [There](https://www.ams.org/notices/200603/fea-cook.pdf) is also an older 2006 article with Stephen Cook in the Notices of the AMS. 

There are at least two natural connections between dynamics and computation. In one direction, the question *"which properties of which dynamical systems can be computed and how efficiently?"* is foundational to mapping the limits of applied mathematics. In the opposite direction, *"how powerful a computation can a given dynamical system simulate robustly?"* touches upon the [Church-Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis) and questions of [hypercomputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation).
