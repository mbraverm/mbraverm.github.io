A *[dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system)* is a stateful system (often with a continuous state space) evolving over time. Thus, dynamical systems can be (and are being) used to capture the behavior of both natural and articifical systems over time. There are at least two natural connections between dynamics and computation. In one direction, the question "which properties of which dynamical systems can be computed and how efficiently?" is foundational to mapping the limits of applied mathematics. In the opposite direction, "how powerful a computation can a given dynamical system simulate robustly?" touches upon the [Church-Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis) and questions of [hypercomputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation).
