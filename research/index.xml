New bounds on the Grothendieck constant Let be an matrix. It gives rise to the quadratic form . The Grothendieck constant bounds the ratio between the maximum of this form when are unit vectors in a Hilbert space and the maximum of this form when are just real numbers.</description></item><item><title>Writings</title><link>https://mbraverm.github.io/research/writings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mbraverm.github.io/research/writings/</guid><description>An essay on the need for personal digital advocates (Last updated: December 2020)
Abstract: There is a growing power imbalance between companies who have access to powerful algorithms and processing capacity and users who donâ€™t. To restore the balance, we need to put equally powerful algorithms in the hands of individuals. There are two concrete steps we recommend:
(1) there should be a new regulatory framework which creates an unbreakable commitment for an advocate (a digital service) to work exclusively in the interest of its client;</description></item><item><title>All Papers</title><link>https://mbraverm.github.io/research/all-papers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mbraverm.github.io/research/all-papers/</guid><description>Selected recent publications Network coding in undirected graphs is either very helpful or not helpful at all
