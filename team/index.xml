Unfortunately, due to large volumes of email, I am not able to respond to individual inquiries about joining Princeton or our group. Some general details can be found below.
High school and undergraduate students If you are a Princeton undergrad, and are interested in the possibility of doing Junior/Senior independent work, please email me to make an appointment and discuss your interests.</description></item><item><title>Members</title><link>https://mbraverm.github.io/team/members/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mbraverm.github.io/team/members/</guid><description>Current Group Members Graduate students: Postdocs: Vijay Bhattiprolu John Peebles Sahil Singla Alumni: With first place of employment/study:

Princeton CS Theory group: Please see Princeton academic jobs portal here, and navigate to opportunities in Computer Science. The Theory Group typically advertises a postdoctoral research associate position and an associate research scholar position, which is slightly more senior. Both positions are reviewed in the late Fall, with the goal of making decisions by January/February.</description></item><item><title>Undergraduate Projects</title><link>https://mbraverm.github.io/team/undergraduate-projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mbraverm.github.io/team/undergraduate-projects/</guid><description>2015-16: Esther Rolf &amp;lsquo;16, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Capturing multiparty communication: extending notions of information theory to topology-dependent multiparty problems&amp;rdquo; Michael Yitayew &amp;lsquo;16, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Short-circuit error resilience in Boolean formulas&amp;rdquo; Zhongxia (Ricky) Zhao &amp;lsquo;16, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Non-clearing and combinatorial Walrasian equilibria&amp;rdquo; Clement Lee &amp;lsquo;17, F15, &amp;ldquo;Fast polynomial factorization&amp;rdquo; Blair Wang &amp;lsquo;17, F15, &amp;ldquo;Discovery of spurious statistical relationships&amp;rdquo; 2014-15: David Durst &amp;lsquo;15, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Beyond3D: Visualizing high-dimensional data sets&amp;rdquo; James Pinkerton &amp;lsquo;15, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Energy function arguments in finding Tower of Majority lower bounds&amp;rdquo; 2013-14: Andra Constantinescu &amp;lsquo;14, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Behavioral mechanism design - accounting for the mental cost of choosing&amp;rdquo; Mihai Roman &amp;lsquo;14, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Computational complexity of pricing derivatives&amp;rdquo; Leonardo Stedile &amp;lsquo;14, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Primal-dual based weights and other kidney exchange mechanisms&amp;rdquo; Valentina Barboy &amp;lsquo;15, F13, &amp;ldquo;An exploration of the accuracy and efficiency of peer grading&amp;rdquo; Stefani Karp &amp;lsquo;15, S14, &amp;ldquo;Information-theoretic approaches to the Unexpected Hanging Paradox&amp;rdquo; Christoph Schlom &amp;lsquo;15, S14, &amp;ldquo;Calibration testing&amp;rdquo; 2012-13: Kevin Mantel &amp;lsquo;13, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Election manipulation through misrepresentation of pre-election polls&amp;rdquo; Gal Oshri &amp;lsquo;13, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;Contracting experts with unknown cost structures&amp;rdquo; Kanika Pasricha, Thesis, &amp;ldquo;The computational hardness of pricing compound securities&amp;rdquo; Ashish Gupta &amp;lsquo;13, F12, &amp;ldquo;An investigation of the usefulness of data preprocessing techniques versus algorithmic sophistication on diabetes prediction&amp;rdquo; Leonardo Stedile &amp;lsquo;14, F12, &amp;ldquo;Analysis of risk in chess&amp;rdquo; Xiao Tian (Elaine) Liew &amp;lsquo;14, F12, &amp;ldquo;Effect of network structure on PageRank of spam&amp;rdquo; Xin Yang Yak &amp;lsquo;14, S13, &amp;ldquo;Do YouTube users upvote Better Comments?</description></item></channel></rss>
